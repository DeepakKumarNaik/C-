Create a class called time that has separate int member data from hours, minute and seconds. One constructor should initialize this data to 0, and another should initialize it to a fixed values. A member function should display it,  in hh:mm:ss format. The final member function should add two objects of type time passed as arguments.

A main() program should create two initialize time objects and one that is not initialized. Then should add the two initialized value together, leaving the result in the third time variable.  Finally it should display the value of this third variable in graphic mode.
