A book shop maintains the inventory of books that are being sold at the shop. The list includes details such as author , title, price, publisher and stock position. Whenever a customer wants a book the sales person input the title and author and the system searches the list and displays wheather it is available or not. If it is not, an appropriate message is displayed. If it is then the system displays the book details and request for the number of copies required. If the requested copies are available, the total cost of the requested copies is displayed, otherwise a meaasge like "Required copies not in stock" is displayed.
